      GotoWork was founded in 2005 for <a href="http://vereijkenkwekerijen.nl/"
      target="_blank">Vereijken Kwekerijen</a>, with the aim of saving both
      time and money regarding taking phone calls from students concerning
      seasonal working possibilities.  Promptly, other horticultural
      organisations enquired as to whether they could implement the same
      GotoWork software into their own companies.  Since then, GotoWork has
      been steadily growing, and is now being used across a spectrum of
      organisations.

      Students, among other flexibly employed individuals, can take advantage
      of the GotoWork software to communicate their availability with a number
      of employers.  GotoWork equally enables employers to communicate
      necessary information with any employees, as well as detailing a strict
      employee rota.

      The Constructors vision for GotoWork lies in continual development for
      increased functionality, and optimised user-experience.  The Constructors
      team maintains this Software as a Service (SaaS) product in-house,
      ensuring its stability, and perfection of key features, such as
      mobile-friendliness.
