      iSlide is a newly-founded social media experience, making it possible to
      project custom images in water slides, and even select a lighting theme.
      The swimmer has the choice to have a photograph taken of their slide
      experience, which can be viewed across a range of tablets upon exiting
      the slide.  Swimmers can then e-mail the selected photos to themselves,
      and proceed to share them across social media platforms of their own
      choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cutting-edge system is currently running at 11 different locations
      throughout Europe, and processes over 50,000 unique photos per month.
      Constructors custom-built the innovative technology for the tablets,
      making it possible to upgrade and/or add new swimming pool locations.
      Total precision and optimal stability is ensured for the underlying
      technical infrastructure to send, and temporarily store content.  iSlide
      was awarded the ANWB innovation prize in 2014 for its ground-breaking
      notion.

    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      Edwin Keijzer of iSlide approached us with the following case, and the
      next step in the progression of iSlide: The goal would be to seamlessly
      integrate additional features, allowing for a completely interactive
      experience for the swimmer.  Swimmers would have the opportunity to
      select light and sound effects at the entrance of the water slide, and to
      specify if they want a photograph to be taken or not.  During the sliding
      experience, swimmers can press interactive buttons to score points,
      competitively.  At the exit of the slide, the points, alongside the
      optional photograph, will be displayed to the swimmer so that sliders may
      compete for the best score.  Ultimately, it must be possible for the
      swimmer to look up their optional photograph on the tablets at the exit
      of the water slide, and to share their content via email or text message.
    </p>

    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      Constructors implemented the temporary, and reliably safe storage of
      applicable photos to a specialised server, unique to each pool.  These
      servers run the vital back-end infrastructure, along with Constructor’s
      flawlessly-built web application in which photos can be looked-up and
      sent via the tablets for optimal user-experience.  As the web application
      can be opened either in portrait of landscape mode, the application has
      also been made fully mobile-friendly.  The servers are remotely updated
      to maintain comprehensive security, and to allow for system updates, and
      web application updates.  During the update times, it is crucial that the
      systems are not interrupted and, as such, Constructor’s exceptional
      stability is paramount.
    </p>

    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>
      The entire development process took 1.5 months and has enabled the
      consistent update of all iSlide systems, and web applications with the
      touch of a button - an update on the 11 slide locations throughout Europe
      can take place in 10 minutes.  Via an encrypted VPN, Constructors and
      iSlide can log in to the server to perform any maintenance.  Our
      diligence is demonstrated through 50,000 iSlide photographs being
      processed per month over 11 European locations, without any downtime in
      the system’s running history.  Safe, reliable, and without downtime.
