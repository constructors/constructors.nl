      SendCloud currently services around 2,240 webshops, and arose from the
      ashes of exasperations that SendCloud founders too experienced as prior
      webshop owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average webshop owner wasted about 10 minutes per package to generate
      a shipping label alone, and that’s not even accounting for the time taken
      to choose the best courier with which to send the package.  As it is the
      webshop owner who ultimately wears the costs, saving time and money leads
      to greater profitability, and ultimately allows for increased
      competitiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      SendCloud is the shipping solution to take the work off your hands: With
      the simple click of a button, a custom shipping label can be created, and
      the package can immediately be shipped, and tracked with track & trace.
      The result is an average overall cost saving of 23 percent, due to
      significantly increased competitiveness, and a drop in manual labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to SendCloud’s ingenious practices, the organisation grew
      considerably in recent years, and possessed immense ambition to expand
      abroad.

    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      Following Belgium’s unique e-commerce market, Constructors was asked to
      facilitate total integration with the Belgian Post Group.  The Belgian
      Post Group has around 27,749 employees connected to a substantial IT
      platform, with which SendCloud wanted to create a link.
    </p>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      The full development of the software to consolidate with the Belgian Post
      Group needed to be established within a timeframe of 2 months.  The
      development particularly included a full review of documentation,
      collaboration with the Belgian Post Group on technical mergers, and the
      programming of precise code to fit within SendCloud’s existing platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entirety of the code written for the Belgian Post Group was tested
      rigorously to ensure the utmost quality, as well as ideal operation.
      Extensive documentation was written to facilitate ease of future ‘bpost’
      updates.
    </p>
    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>
      Full integration with the Belgian Post Company took place within the set
      deadline, and successfully aided SendCloud in tapping into the Belgian
      market.  The number of customers in Belgium grew rapidly, with immense
      customer satisfaction of the integration process reported.  Both regular
      packages, and insured packages requiring a signature are supported with
      the SendCloud/bpost shipping method.
    </p>
    <h3>Germany</h3>
    <p>
      SendCloud has grown in Germany with Constructors’ hosting of <a
      href="http://sendcloud.de/">SendCloud.de</a>.  Constructors enabled
      SendCloud developers to put newer versions of the website online with the
      simple click of button; saving yet more time and money.
